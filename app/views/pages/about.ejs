			<li>First up, wearing the Pirates ballcap and too-cool-for-school demeanor, meet <a href="http://twitter.com/fanelli">Jay Fanelli</a>. Jay’s in charge of colors, shapes, and letters. Oh, and if you want to get your shirt onto Cotton Bureau, Jay’s the one you need to convince.</li>
		 	<li>Second from the left sporting khakis and smouldering intensity is <a href="http://twitter.com/nathanperetic">Nathan Peretic</a>. Nate’s in charge of front-end code, operations, ancient history, rhetoric, and hockey news.</li>
			<li>Styling the Pixel Heart tee and classic green Onitsuka Tigers, <a href="http://twitter.com/chamby">Matthew Chambers</a> is the final and most important member of the website team. He’s the only one we trust to touch the database, and he goes by many names: Chamby, The Beef, or when he’s feeling fancy, Le Boeuf.</li>
			<li>Last (for now), the charming <a href="http://twitter.com/saragardinier">Sara Gardinier</a>, Cotton Bureau’s Chief Fulfillment Officer and Customer Service Czar. If you got a problem, yo, Sara’ll solve it.</li>
